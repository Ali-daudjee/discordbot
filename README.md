# Ali Daudjee's Discord Bot
This bot was written using Node.js
currently the only 2 commands it has is a ping command and a gif search command
## Ping command
Type in the discord chat box "ping" for the bot to reply back with "pong"
 - Used to test the connection with the client and server, making sure all is well in this regard
## Gif command
Type in the Discord chat box "!gif" followed by any searchable phrases or words that are available on a high content filter, or dont search anything at all and get a randomized nature gif!
- Built with the Tenor API
# TO BE ADDED:
 - Tic tac toe vs the Discord Bot
 - Battleship vs the Discord Bot
 - More efficient command handling by using the Node.js file system module
